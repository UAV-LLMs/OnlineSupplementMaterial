# UAV-LLM Survey Dataset

This repository contains the dataset and analysis results for our study on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems. The dataset is organized to support reproducibility and further research on UAV-LLM applications.

## Files Overview

### 1. Survey-English.pdf and Survey-Chinese.pdf
These two files provide the full survey reports in English and Chinese versions, respectively. They summarize the literature review, research methodology, and key findings of the study.

### 2. List_Papers
This file contains detailed information of the 74 selected papers included in our analysis. It provides metadata such as titles, authors, publication venues, and abstracts to facilitate further exploration.

### 3. List_GitHub_Repository
This file contains information for 56 GitHub repositories relevant to UAV-LLM integration. Each entry includes repository name, URL, and a brief description of its relevance to the study.

### 4. Result_Open_Card_Sorting_GitHub_Repository
This file records the results of the open-card sorting analysis for **RQ1: Research status of large models in the field of UAVs**. The analysis identifies functional categories and usage patterns of LLMs in UAV-related repositories. Each repository was assessed for the type of functionality it implements, which was then clustered into higher-level categories.

### 5. Result_Open_Card_Sorting_Papers
This file contains the results of the open-card sorting analysis for **RQ2: Differences between academia and industry in UAV-LLM integration**. Two researchers independently analyzed the selected 74 papers to extract functions, use cases, and applied methodologies. The results were then clustered to highlight differences in focus and approaches between academic research and industry practice.
